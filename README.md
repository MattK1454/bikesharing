# Bike Sharing Project

## Overview

This analysis used bike sharing data from the Citi Bike sharing program in New York City to analyze how the program works and its viability to be implemented in Des Moines, Iowa.

This visualization looks at the average trip duration vs birth year. If the trend of the data is prioritized then there is an observation of increased trip duration as the age of the user moves towards younger users. This suggests people born more recently will utilize the bike for longer periods. The time measure for trip duration is in seconds. The birth year begins at 1880 which can not be accurate, if we assume the data was recorded with errors but the overall trend is accurate even with the errors, then the analysis of younger users use the bikes for longer holds for a point of interest in the project analysis.

![Bike Utilization](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Bike%20Utilization.png)

This visualization, at first glance, is difficult to understand. What is displayed here are details pertaining to the amount of use each bike received in the month of August in 2019. Each dot represents a bicycle in the Citi Bike sharing program. The size of the dot is in relation to the amount of use in seconds the bike experienced during the month of August. The larger the dot, the more the bike was used. This data suggests tracking the bikes most often used may allow for a deeper understanding of some of the factors encouraging use of the bike sharing program.

## Summary

The analysis for the Citi Bike sharing program from the month of August in 2019 shows the bike sharing program is very active in New York City. Looking at the stories and dashboards linked to above, evidence suggests a consistent level of use especially around sites strongly linked with high population areas/tourist locations. The data also demonstrates a high level of use for particular bikes shown by the average tripduration visualization. Data also suggests there is an upward trend for bike sharing as age decreases. Data also suggests men make the most use of the bike sharing program particularly from the 5am to the 8am hours. There is also evidence suggesting the most bike trips take place on weekdays from 8am to 9am, 5pm to 7pm, and Saturdays from 10am to 6pm. With the average trip duration trending upward for younger generation, it is reasonable to state any program implimented would need to be done in a location with a younger male population and within tourist locations.

Two possible visualizations that could be added to this analysis are:
* Customer type by gender
* Customer type by age and average trip duration
