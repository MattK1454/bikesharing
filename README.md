# Bike Sharing Project

## Overview

This analysis uses bike data from the New York City Citi bike share program collected in the month of August in 2019. Visualizations are generated to allow for an underatandinging of the bike share program. Insight generated from the data will be used to explore the viability of implementing a similar system in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.
