# Bike Sharing Project

## Overview

This analysis uses bike data from the New York City Citi bike share program collected in the month of August in 2019. Visualizations are generated to allow for an underatandinging of the bike share program. Insight generated from the data will be used to explore the viability of implementing a similar system in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

![Peak hours of use for August](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

This visualization shows bike trips per hour in the month of August. The visualization shows the hours of 1am to 4am had the least amount of total bike trips in month of August 2019. The hours of 5am and 6am had the highest number of total trips.

![Gender Breakdown](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

The idea behind generating this visualization is to attempt to understand the breakdown of customer by gender (male, female, unkown). The data shows males generated the greatest number of trips.

![Checkout time for Users](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Time%20for%20Users.png)

In order to properly manage resources and schedule repairs for the bikes when the bikes are most capable of being repaired, it is necessary to look for when the greatest number of bikes are being used (aka checked out). This visualization demonstrates the highest number of bikes being checked out peaks from 5am to to 6am. The number of bikes checked out begins tapering off starting at 6am to it's lowest point at 12am.

![Checkout times by gender](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

This visualization breaks down the previous visualization to show how bike trips by hour are broken down by gender. Data here supports the second visualization showing males made use of the bike sharing system the most in the month of August.

![Trips by Weekday per hour](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

This visualization maps number of bike returns for each hour by weekday. This visualization shows the highest level of returns for bikes on weekdays is between 7am and 10am on weekdays and between 5pm to 8pm on the evenings of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. The weekends show a roughly consistent level of bike returns throughout the midday period on Saturdays and Sundays.

Note: Wednesdays appear to have a lower number of bike returns during the evening hours of 5pm to 8pm as compared to the other weekdays.

![Trips by gender (weekday per hour)](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

This visualization is a breakdown of the previous visualization by gender. The data supports males generated the highest returns of bikes.

![User trips by gender by weekday](https://github.com/MattK1454/bikesharing/blob/main/images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

This visualization looks at how many bikes are checked out by user type with respect to gender by weekday

## Summary



Two possible visualizations that could be added to this analysis are:
* Bike use by id by station
* Customer type by age and average trip duration
